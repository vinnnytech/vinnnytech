## Hi, I am Vinny !
<a href="https://linkedin.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>


Passionate cybersecurity enthusiast with a deep interest in protecting digital spaces and staying ahead of emerging cyber threats.

## Objective
To share simple, structured, and beginner-friendly cybersecurity projects that help others learn SOC analysis, SIEM usage, and threat detection fundamentals while I grow my own skill set in security operations.

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
